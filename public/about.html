<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hello, My name is Sirisha Neupane.I am a Clinical Psychology major who is currently in the process of switching 
  to the field of Web Development. I am excited to embark on this new journey and apply my skills and knowledge to 
  a different field.Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a strong foundation in psychology, which has 
  given me a unique perspective on human behavior and thought processes. As I transition to web development, I am
 eager to learn new technologies and programming languages and explore the exciting opportunities in the tech industry.
 With my passion for creativity and problem-solving, I believe that web development will provide me with a challenging
  and fulfilling career path.
</p>

<p>I love spending time with loved ones, pursuing hobbies or interests, trying new foods or activities, and 
  experiencing new cultures. I dislike negative things such as feeling frustrated or stressed, dealing with conflict
   or criticism, or experiencing physical discomfort or pain. My family means everyting to me and I have a small brother 
  in my house who is piece of heart of our family.</p>

<p>Therefore, I am a great god beleiver where my religion is Hinduism. I beleive that for those who believe in gods,
   it can provide  a sense of purpose, guidance, and comfort in difficult times. It may also provide a moral code or
    set of values to live by, and offer a sense of community and belonging with others who share similar beliefs. </p>
